# Wall-E

# Idea Proposal (REFINED & REALISTIC)

My idea for the final presentation is to make a real life replica of the Disney Pixar character Wall-e. This image is a complex recreation of the animated Robot.

My Wall-e Robot would be much simpler and would:
1) Have servos that would control
- Both arms
- Hand Rotation
- Eyes movement (servos within light foam, board "head")
2) Motors that would allow the wall-e bot to drive around
3) Use bluettoth to replica the sounds made by Wall-e in the film

I would like to make a fully autonomous performance reminiscent of the opening scenes of the movie Wall-e, re-telling the classic story however, I am also open to having a controlled Wall-e or at last, remote controlled/ dependant aspects as well.

I mainly want wall-e to enter the stae and look at different objects. Then, I would project the romantic film he watches in the actual movie and he would face the audience while the movie is behind him, implying that he too is watching the film. His eyes would droop down and he would try to make his hands touch.

# Construction

The Contruction section will be divided into sub-sections wherein each major construction point of Wall-e will be explained in more depth. Above is a general sketch of wall-e and the base ideas for all his components.

## Head

#### Sketch

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Sketch_Head.jpg)

Above is the original sketch and plan I head for Wall-e's head. I wanted his head and more specifically, his eyes, to be as true to the original as possible as it is the most recognizeable aspect of Wall-e. The head would be controlled by two motors that would be perpendicularly attached. The foam material should allow for ease of servo movement due to it's light weight

#### Materials used

- Foam (Head shaping)
- 2 Large Servos
- Wood (Neck)

#### Process & Product

This is the base fina product. I stayed true to the stacking of foam eyes idea but realized that the back design I had initially sketched out was far too complicated and would make the Wall-e head unecessarily heavier as it would mean it would block the placement for the servos, or at least make it much more complicated, as it's placement may interfere with the movement of the servos due to its proximity to it. Knowing this, I decided to add a flat plane of foam to resemble the general shape of the back design I initially planned and left no foam on the underside of the head, where the servos are. I added on a Wooden block to make the middle of the head the point of weight equilibrium.

Another important thing that I did not originally consider was the placement of the double servo. I originally planned to put it at the end of the Wall-e head but this would mean there would be a uneven weight distribution, which is where the wooden block came in. THe block allowed me to confidently place the doule servo in the middle of the head, where the head would easily balance and have support.


## Arms

#### Sketch

The Arms proved to be my biggest challenge both construction wise and conceptually. I knew from the start that it would be difficult to achieve both movement in the y-axis as well as roatation of the arms, in order to mimic the "holding hands" action shown in the movie (Which would be the big awww moment of the performance.) I originally planned for 2 motors to be attached to each other, one controlling rotation and one controlling movement up and down.

#### Materials Used (Per Arm)

- Foam (For the arm and hands)
- 1 large servo
- 1 micro servo

#### Process & Product

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Arm.jpg)

As shown in the final base product above, I didn't stick to the original plan. I was right in predicting the weight distribution would be too much and the servos would not be able to confidently lift the arms and mantain itself on them, so the arms would keep falling off. Instead, I decided to have a servo at the end of the arm attached to its side to control the lifting of the arms. This worked a lot better.

However, the issue with this in controlling hand movement. I decided to disregard the planned material in the Sketch section and built the entirety of the arm out of foam, as it is much lighter and easier to lift. The, I buil a channel in the arms in which I would be able to attach a micro servo and run its wirings through. 

##### ( I haven'y built this yet becuase there wasn't enough foam, but Im going to build a simple thing hand and attach it to the micro servo, which would control the rotation of the hand)

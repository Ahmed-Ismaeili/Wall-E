# Wall-E

# Idea Proposal (REFINED & REALISTIC)

My idea for the final presentation is to make a real life replica of the Disney Pixar character Wall-e. This image is a complex recreation of the animated Robot.

My Wall-e Robot would be much simpler and would:
1) Have servos that would control
- Both arms
- Hand Rotation
- Eyes movement (servos within light foam, board "head")
2) Motors that would allow the wall-e bot to drive around
3) Use bluettoth to replica the sounds made by Wall-e in the film

I would like to make a fully autonomous performance reminiscent of the opening scenes of the movie Wall-e, re-telling the classic story however, I am also open to having a controlled Wall-e or at last, remote controlled/ dependant aspects as well.

I mainly want wall-e to enter the stae and look at different objects. Then, I would project the romantic film he watches in the actual movie and he would face the audience while the movie is behind him, implying that he too is watching the film. His eyes would droop down and he would try to make his hands touch.

# Construction

The Contruction section will be divided into sub-sections wherein each major construction point of Wall-e will be explained in more depth. Above is a general sketch of wall-e and the base ideas for all his components.

## Head

#### Sketch

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Sketch_Head.jpg)

Above is the original sketch and plan I head for Wall-e's head. I wanted his head and more specifically, his eyes, to be as true to the original as possible as it is the most recognizeable aspect of Wall-e. The head would be controlled by two motors that would be perpendicularly attached. The foam material should allow for ease of servo movement due to it's light weight

#### Materials used

- Foam (Head shaping)
- 2 Large Servos
- Wood (Neck)

#### Process & Product

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Head_Side.jpg)

This is the base fina product. I stayed true to the stacking of foam eyes idea but realized that the back design I had initially sketched out was far too complicated and would make the Wall-e head unecessarily heavier as it would mean it would block the placement for the servos, or at least make it much more complicated, as it's placement may interfere with the movement of the servos due to its proximity to it. Knowing this, I decided to add a flat plane of foam to resemble the general shape of the back design I initially planned and left no foam on the underside of the head, where the servos are. I added on a Wooden block to make the middle of the head the point of weight equilibrium.

Another important thing that I did not originally consider was the placement of the double servo. I originally planned to put it at the end of the Wall-e head but this would mean there would be a uneven weight distribution, which is where the wooden block came in. THe block allowed me to confidently place the doule servo in the middle of the head, where the head would easily balance and have support.

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Neck_Bottom.jpg)

I then cut out two wooden planks to act us the support e=neck for Wall-E. To attach them to the wooden body, I used L-Brackets both on the bottom and on the top to ensure stability. However, I did not use L-brackets on both sides of the neck. This means that the eck to not securely fastened and still has a little wobble and shake to it, which i believe plays into the aesthetic appeal fo a vulnerable and feeble Wall-E.


## Arms

#### Sketch

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Sketch_Hands.jpg)

The Arms proved to be my biggest challenge both construction wise and conceptually. I knew from the start that it would be difficult to achieve both movement in the y-axis as well as roatation of the arms, in order to mimic the "holding hands" action shown in the movie (Which would be the big awww moment of the performance.) I originally planned for 2 motors to be attached to each other, one controlling rotation and one controlling movement up and down.

#### Materials Used (Per Arm)

- Foam (For the arm and hands)
- 1 large servo
- 1 micro servo

#### Process & Product

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Arm.jpg)

As shown in the final base product above, I didn't stick to the original plan. I was right in predicting the weight distribution would be too much and the servos would not be able to confidently lift the arms and mantain itself on them, so the arms would keep falling off. Instead, I decided to have a servo at the end of the arm attached to its side to control the lifting of the arms. This worked a lot better.

However, the issue with this in controlling hand movement. I decided to disregard the planned material in the Sketch section and built the entirety of the arm out of foam, as it is much lighter and easier to lift. The, I buil a channel in the arms in which I would be able to attach a micro servo and run its wirings through.

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Hand_Servo.jpg)

This is the implementation fo the hand I chose to use. I cut out rectangular peices of foma and gave "palm" two opposing 45 degree bezels to give a more interesting and accurate shaping to Wall-E's hands. The two pieces of foam are attached using hot glue and skewers. I then glued the micro servo onto a piece of cardboard which is securely glued onti to the hands. By using foam for the hands, the meothed of fastening and securing the attachment of the cardboard and servo became a minor issue, as the hands are very light and easy to lift. The servo is attached to the arm using a series of cardboard cut outs and hot glue, while its wirings run through the channel mentioned previously

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Arm_Brace.jpg)

To attach the arm servo to the body, I made a wooden "brace" of sorts to tightly cling onto the servo and give a clear and firm place for the servo to rest. The brace is wood glued onto the body and has a layer of hot glue around the perimeter. This was to secure the brace while the wood glue dried. I plan to fasten the servo to the glue using hot glue and screws on both sides.

## Wheels

#### Sketch

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Sketch_Wheels.jpg)

The wheels proved to be quite challenging and compromise had to be made becuase I think it is not feasible to build a working track like the original Wall-E in the given amount of time. Instead, I plan on attaching the wheels to the base of Wall-E's body and using cardboard with something sturdy yet malleable like wire to make a track like shape on glue that onto the body. The cardboard will be there for purely aesthetic purpose and will not really serve as a functional component to the bot. This would allow for simple movement using to DC motors, while still retaining the iconic Wall-E image.

#### Materials Used
- 2 DC Motors
- 4 L-Brackets
- 8 DC Motor bolts
- 4 1/2 nails
- 1 Caster wheel
- Wood

#### Process & Product

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Wheels_Bolt.jpg)

Here are the wheels bolted down to the bottom of Wall-E, I used wide L-brackets and the specific motor bolts to attach them and the used a series of 1/2 nails to drill the brackets and the motors to the bottom of the body.

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Caster.jpg)

I then took measurements of how tall the motors were compared to the bottom of the body and cut wood and sanded so that the caster wheel would stand on even ground. I was not fully confident with drilling a nail intot the wood becuase of my chi=oice of wwod, so i decided to wood glue the caster support structure on instead.


## Body

![alt text](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ismaeili/Wall-E/blob/master/Walle%20-%20Body.jpg)

Tho Body was made in teh scene shop and is a 45 x 45 cm cube. There is no back side s that there would be easy access and storage for and to the electronic components inside of the wall-e bot. Wall-e's simple geomtric shape allowed for a simple design and a focus on aestheitic appearence and technical programming and functionality.

After that I painted hima dn tried to make him as aestheically accurate as i cold.
